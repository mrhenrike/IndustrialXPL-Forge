"""IEC 62443-3-2 Zone and Conduit Security Audit.

Interactive assessment module that guides operators and assessors through
the IEC 62443-3-2 Zone and Conduit Model for Industrial Automation and
Control Systems (IACS). The questionnaire covers ten key security properties
across the zone/conduit design and produces a Security Level (SL) maturity
rating from SL0 to SL4 with identified gaps.

No network target required — this is a documentary/interview-based assessment.
