"""NIST SP 800-82r3 OT Security Control Checklist.

Interactive assessment module covering the NIST Special Publication 800-82
Revision 3 (Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security) control families
for industrial environments. For each family, 3-5 critical OT-specific controls
are listed and the assessor records implementation status.

Control families covered:
    AC (Access Control), AU (Audit and Accountability), CA (Security Assessment),
    CM (Configuration Management), IA (Identification and Authentication),
    IR (Incident Response), MA (Maintenance), MP (Media Protection),
    PE (Physical and Environmental Protection), RA (Risk Assessment),
    SA (System and Services Acquisition), SC (System and Communications Protection),
    SI (System and Information Integrity), SR (Supply Chain Risk Management)

No network target required — documentary/interview-based assessment.
