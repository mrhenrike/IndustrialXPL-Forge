"""ICS Cyber Kill Chain — 14-Stage OT Attack Lifecycle Mapping.

Interactive knowledge module presenting the ICS-specific Cyber Kill Chain
(based on Dragos / SANS ICS analysis and MITRE ATT&CK for ICS). Maps
14 stages from initial reconnaissance through physical impact, with real-world
TTP examples from Stuxnet, Industroyer/CRASHOVERRIDE, TRITON/TRISIS, and
FrostyGoop, and corresponding MITRE ATT&CK for ICS technique IDs.

No network target required — knowledge/training module.
