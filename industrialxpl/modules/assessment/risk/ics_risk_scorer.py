"""ICS/OT Risk Scorer — Top 10 SCADA/ICS Vulnerability Assessment.

Interactive risk scoring tool for ICS/OT environments. Evaluates 10 critical
risk vectors aligned with NIST SP 800-82r3, IEC 62443, and MITRE ATT&CK for ICS.

Each vector is scored:
  - YES (vulnerability present):     HIGH_SCORE
  - PARTIAL (partially mitigated):   PARTIAL_SCORE
  - NO (mitigated/not applicable):   0

Output: scored risk table with gap analysis and prioritized recommendations.
Overall risk level: CRITICAL (>70), HIGH (50-70), MEDIUM (30-50), LOW (<30).

Risk vectors (Top 10 ICS vulnerabilities):
  1. Default / hardcoded credentials
  2. Absence of encryption (plaintext protocols)
  3. Exposed HMI / SCADA web interface
  4. Weak network segmentation (IT/OT flat network)
  5. Legacy and unsupported software
  6. Insecure remote access (VPN, RDP, TeamViewer)
  7. Missing DoS / rate-limiting protection
  8. Malware susceptibility (no EDR, removable media)
  9. Supply chain / third-party vendor risk
  10. IT/OT organizational misalignment
