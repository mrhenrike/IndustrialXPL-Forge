"""IACS Cyber Security Incident Response Playbook — Interactive Checklist.

Interactive Incident Response playbook for Industrial Automation and Control
Systems (IACS) environments. Structured in 4 phases following IEC 62443-2-1
and NIST SP 800-61r3 adapted for OT:

  Phase 1 — DETECTION     : Identify OT compromise indicators
  Phase 2 — CONTAINMENT   : Isolate zones/conduits, physical safety
  Phase 3 — ERADICATION   : Remove malware, restore PLC/HMI integrity
  Phase 4 — RECOVERY       : Backup restore, process validation

Each phase presents ~5 checklist items. Operator confirms each step with
DONE / SKIP / NOTE. Final report summarizes completed/skipped/noted items.
